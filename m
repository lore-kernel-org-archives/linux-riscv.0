The tests are already in their own patches: patches 4 and 5.  Yes, this patchset
has a negative diffstat once you subtract them.

(And most of the positive diffstat in the tests is generated test vectors.  The
rest is mostly code that I'll reuse later in tests for other hash functions; it
just gets blamed to this one because it's the first one.)

I'd really prefer to keep testing as a first-class citizen.  Tests should be
contributed along with the code itself.

And the point of this patchset is not just "code movement", but rather adding a
library API, including documentation *and tests*.

Later, I'll be converting various in-kernel users to use that API, just as I've
been doing for crc32 and sha256.  It's already been shown that the
"librarification" works well and is much simpler than the old-school Crypto API.

If you really want patches 4-5 in a separate patchset that's based on this one,
I can do that.  Ultimately, the result would be the same.

I think your request for there to be a separate "tests" pull request is a
non-starter, though.  That would imply separate git trees, and we then wouldn't
be able to land tests at the same time as the code itself.
