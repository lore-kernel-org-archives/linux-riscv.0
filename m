Thanks.  I see less maintainer tags for the parts that touch other ports than I 
would feel comfortable merging.  I'm going to let this sit in my inbox for 
a bit and we'll see if anything collects.

For patch sets I submit that clean up other ports I've attempted to split the 
patch into N patch sets, where:

* One part adds the generic support, which starts out as dead code.
* One part per arch uses the generic support.

This is a bit of a headache, but it at least allows us to get the RISC-V 
version that uses the generic support in quickly while waiting on acks from the 
other arch maintainers.

Like I said, I'll wait a bit and hope people ack.

Thanks!
