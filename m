I can sympathize.

One option would be to pull the arch_unregister_cpu() out so it
happens in one place in both the present = 0 and enabled = 0 cases but
I'm not sure if it's safe to reorder the contents of 
acpi_processor_not_present() as it's followed by a bunch of things.

Would looks something like

if (cpu_present(pr->id)) {
	if (!(sta & ACPI_STA_DEVICE_PRESENT)) {
		acpi_processor_make_not_present(device); /* Remove arch_cpu_unregister() */
	} else if (!(sta & ACPI_STA_DEVICE_ENABLED)) {
		/* Nothing to do in this case */
	} else {
		return; /* Firmware did something silly - probably racing */
	}
	arch_unregister_cpu(pr->id);

	return;
}

yes it does (I poked it to see) which indeed isn't good (unless I've
broken my setup in some obscure way).

Seems we need a few more things than arch_unregister_cpu() pulled out
in the above code.

It's all annoyingly messy at the root of things, but indeed you've found
some issues in current implementation.  Feels like just ripping out
a bunch of stuff from acpi_processor_make_not_present() and calling it
for both paths will probably work, but I've not tested that yet.
