I have noticed following:

1. plic_irq_toggle() works on all present CPUs which means an
IRQ will be enabled/disabled for all present CPUs. This further
imply that whenever an IRQ is triggered, all online CPUs will take
the interrupt but only one CPU will be successful in claiming the
IRQ and other CPUs will check for IRQ in vain.

2. irq_set_affinity() is not available which means IRQ balancing
will not work.

3. A PLIC context is for a particular HART+MODE. A HW designer
can choose to connect PLIC context only for particular MODE of
HART/CPU whereas this driver assumes that we have context
available for both M-mode and S-mode of all HARTs/CPUs.
