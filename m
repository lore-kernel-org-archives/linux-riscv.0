Hi,

Yes, I didn't put them in because I changed the functionality in 2/13 
and there is a bug fix in 5/13. I thought you might want to do a quick 
diff of the git v6->v7 tree.

Although given that most of the changes were in response to your 
comments in v6 I probably should have just put the tags in.


Thanks,
