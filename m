With 1 MiB messages, I get 1913 MB/s with ARMv8 CE and 142 MB/s with QCE.

(BTW, that's single-buffer ARMv8 CE.  My two-buffer code is over 3000 MB/s.)

I then changed my benchmark code to take full advantage of the async API and
submit as many requests as the hardware can handle.  (This would be a best-case
scenario for QCE; in many real use cases this is not possible.)  Result with QCE
was 58 MB/s with 4 KiB messages or 155 MB/s for 1 MiB messages.

So yes, QCE seems to have only one queue, and even that one queue is *much*
slower than just using the CPU.  It's even slower than the generic C code.

And until I fixed it recently, the Crypto API defaulted to using QCE instead of
ARMv8 CE.

But this seems to be a common pattern among the offload engines.
I noticed a similar issue with Intel QAT, which I elaborate on in this patch:
