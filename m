I haven't seen any review on this.  It looks fine to me, but I'm not qualified 
to review it as I don't really know anything about core MM stuff -- and I 
certainly don't feel comfortable taking this through my tree.

I've To'd linux-mm, hopefully it just got lost in the shuffle during the merge 
window.
