Sigh...

4.	Entering and exiting either idle or nohz_full usermode execution
	at task level can race with interrupts and NMIs attempting to
	make this same transition.  (And you had much to do with the
	current code that mediates the NMI races!)

Yes.

Also, the ordering can sometimes be implemnted at a distance, but it
really does have to be there.

I think the potential performance wins are big enough to justify a bona fide ordinary if statement or two :)  I'm also contemplating whether it could make sense to make this whole thing be unconditionally configured in if the performance in the case where no one uses it (i.e. everything is INTERMEDIATE instead of USER) is good enough.

Both sound like they would be nice to have...

...give or take feasibility, of course!  ;-)
