I'm just worried that I am going to see 15 different versions of this
property when 14 other vendors also decide to create support for having
a trusted world.

I think you misunderstood, I don't mind linux seeing it, I think having
the configuration information in the consumer node is the problem.
Your example below goes away from that, which I approve of.

You're gonna cause issues with this because the node address matches
your "partition id" property when it needs to match reg.
Matching "partition id" rather than what you have as "reg" actually
makes more sense though, so I would retain that.
I'd be include to move sifive,partition-id to reg and then rework your
reg property to some new name, because it doesn't describe a register
region belonging to this device.
Possibly I would split what's currently called reg into separate size
and address properties and split partition-rule too.

Does the final "config" bit of partition-rule provide any value to
consumers? The answer is no, right? Cos the interrupts are going to be
reported to m-mode rather than s-mode.

Right, but we need to consider what the final support will look like

Whether or not you are trusted, does it not make sense to be able to
request that the firmware give you access to a peripheral? Ultimately
opensbi will be making the configuration edits, but I don't think the
kernel being untrusted precludes it having an access controller driver,
as that driver will just use an ecall rather than manipulate directly.

That said, I will not expect you to provide that driver now, but unless
reconfiguration at runtime is not supported by hardware this needs to
be considered.

Cheers,
Conor.
