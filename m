I wonder if we still need this.  The commit message says:

    A concurrent page fault on a page newly marked read-only by the page
    copy might trigger wp_page_copy() and a anon_vma_prepare(vma) on the
    source vma, defeating the anon_vma_clone() that wasn't done because the
    parent vma originally didn't have an anon_vma, but we now might end up
    copying a pte entry for a page that has one.

But we're holding the mmap_lock for write here, and we need to hold the
mmap_lock for read in order to change a vma->anon_vma (asserted in
__anon_vma_prepare() with mmap_assert_locked()).

At the time of this commit, lock_vma_under_rcu() contained:

        /* find_mergeable_anon_vma uses adjacent vmas which are not locked */
        if (!vma->anon_vma && !vma_is_tcp(vma))
                goto inval;

so we really did have to wait for read holders to finish the fault.
But commit a373baed5a9d deferred the check for a NULL anon VMA until we
actually needed it, so I think commit fb49c455323f's logic was invalidated
by a373baed5a9d.

Maybe I'm wrong.  This is all a bit out of my normal area.

Possibly we have to adjust some assertions to check that either we have
the VMA locked or we have the MM write locked.  That doesn't seem
unreasonable.

I was perhaps unclear.  What I mean is that the child may or may not
observe them as having happened.

Yup.

Is it that fb49c455323f commit message is insufficient and we need to
prevent simultaneous fork/page fault for other reasons, then?

... could we fix this by taking the ptlock during the copy operation?
