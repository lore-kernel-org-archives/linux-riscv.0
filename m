If I am not wrong, we need to change the interrupt-extended property in 
PLIC DT entry as well. Currently, there are 5 entries corresponding to 
individual HLIC. I was also planning to start working on converting HLIC 
to per-cpu but it got delayed because of travel.

Christoph: I am not sure if you have access to HighFive Unleashed board. 
If not I would be happy to test it on the board whenever your patches 
are ready.
