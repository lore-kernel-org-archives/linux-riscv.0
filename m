So using crc32c() + ext4 + x86 as an example (but SHA-256 would be very
similar), the current behavior is that ext4.ko depends on the crc32c_arch()
symbol.  That causes crc32-x86.ko to be loaded, which then depends on the
crc32c_base() symbol as a fallback, which causes crc32.ko to be loaded too.  My
idea is to consolidate the two crc32 modules into one (they always go together,
after all), keeping the same symbols.  The main challenge is just the current
directory structure.

Your suggestion sounds like: ext4.ko would depend on the crc32c() symbol, which
would be defined in *both* crc32-x86.ko and crc32.ko.  The module loader would
try to load crc32-x86.ko first.  If the CPU does not support any of the x86
accelerated CRC32 code, then loading that module would fail.  The module loader
would then load crc32.ko instead.

Does any of the infrastructure to handle "this symbol is in multiple modules and
they must be loaded in this particular order" actually exist, though?

And how do we avoid the issues the crypto API often has where the accelerated
modules don't get loaded, causing slow generic code to unnecessarily be used?

IMO this sounds questionable compared to just using static keys and/or branches,
which we'd need anyway to support the non-modular case.

Moving the static_call into the generic code might make sense.  I don't think
it's a win in all cases currently, though.  Only x86 and PPC32 actually have a
real static_call implementation; everywhere else it's an indirect call which is
slower than a static branch.  Also, some arch code is just usable
unconditionally without any CPU feature check, e.g. the MIPS ChaCha code.  That
doesn't use (or need to use) a static call or branch at all.

Also, while the centralized static_call would *allow* for the generic code to be
loaded while the arch code is not, in the vast majority of cases that would be a
bug, not a feature.  The generic crypto infrastructure has that bug, and this
has caused a huge amount of pain over the years.  People have to go out of the
way to ensure that the arch-optimized crypto code gets loaded.  And they often
forget, resulting in the slow generic code being used unnecessarily...

Making the arch-optimized code be loaded through a direct symbol dependency
solves that problem.
