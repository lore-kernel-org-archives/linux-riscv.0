It's usually best not to change an existing system if there are no good
reasons, so I'd ask why you think a pixel-type property would be better
(including when taking into account the fact that we would have to
maintain the advantech,2121wtr driver separately) if you want to go that
way. Otherwise, if we were developing this from scratch, I would have no
real preference.

There's been a very long discussion in the past (multiple discussions
actually) regarding whether timings should be set in DT or in drivers.
There were multiple arguments supporting both sides, without (it seems)
a clear winner. If you want driver-side timings for dual-link panels,
I'd like to understand why you think that's better. If the reasons are
the same as the ones expressed when we discussed simple panels, you
should also look at whether or not any of the fears expressed on either
side have materialized.
