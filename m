Thinking about this some more, I'm not so sure about the connection
with removing pcibios_add_device().  This host_bridge->add_dev() hook
would be for host bridge-specific things, while pcibios_add_device()
is for arch-specific things.

I'd still love to get rid of pcibios_add_device() (especially the
non-arch-specific things like the pci_claim_resource() in s390); I'm
just not sure yet whether this particular patch is the vehicle.
