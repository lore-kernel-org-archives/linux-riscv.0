Right, I missed the fact that x86 reports a different cpumask for
topology_core_cpumask() which defines the core_siblings exported through
sysfs than the mask used to define MC level in the scheduler topology.
The sysfs core_siblings is defined by the package_id, while the MC level
is defined by the LLC.

Thanks for pointing this out.

On arm64 MC level and sysfs core_siblings are currently defined using
the same mask, but we can't break sysfs, so using different masks is the
only option.
