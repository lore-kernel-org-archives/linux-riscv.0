Following up, I think that x86 can do this all with a single atomic (in the common case) per usermode round trip.  Imagine:

struct fancy_cpu_state {
  u32 work; // <-- writable by any CPU
  u32 status; // <-- readable anywhere; writable locally
};

status includes KERNEL, USER, and maybe INDETERMINATE.  (INDETERMINATE means USER but we're not committing to doing work.)

Exit to user mode:

atomic_set(&my_state->status, USER);

(or, in the lazy case, set to INDETERMINATE instead.)

Entry from user mode, with IRQs off, before switching to kernel CR3:

if (my_state->status == INDETERMINATE) {
  // we were lazy and we never promised to do work atomically.
  atomic_set(&my_state->status, KERNEL);
  this_entry_work = 0;
} else {
  // we were not lazy and we promised we would do work atomically
  atomic exchange the entire state to { .work = 0, .status = KERNEL }
  this_entry_work = (whatever we just read);
}

if (PTI) {
  switch to kernel CR3 *and flush if this_entry_work says to flush*
} else {
  flush if this_entry_work says to flush;
}

do the rest of the work;



I suppose that a lot of the stuff in ti_flags could merge into here, but it could be done one bit at a time when people feel like doing so.  And I imagine, but I'm very far from confident, that RCU could use this instead of the current context tracking code.


The idea behind INDETERMINATE is that there are plenty of workloads that frequently switch between user and kernel mode and that would rather accept a few IPIs to avoid the heavyweight atomic operation on user -> kernel transitions.  So the default behavior could be to do KERNEL -> INDETERMINATE instead of KERNEL -> USER, but code that wants to be in user mode for a long time could go all the way to USER.  We could make it sort of automatic by noticing that we're returning from an IRQ without a context switch and go to USER (so we would get at most one unneeded IPI per normal user entry), and we could have some nice API for a program that intends to hang out in user mode for a very long time (cpu isolation users, for example) to tell the kernel to go immediately into USER mode.  (Don't we already have something that could be used for this purpose?)

Hmm, now I wonder if it would make sense for the default behavior of Linux to be like that.  We could call it ONEHZ.  It's like NOHZ_FULL except that user threads that don't do syscalls get one single timer tick instead of many or none.


Anyway, I think my proposal is pretty good *if* RCU could be made to use it -- the existing context tracking code is fairly expensive, and I don't think we want to invent a new context-tracking-like mechanism if we still need to do the existing thing.
