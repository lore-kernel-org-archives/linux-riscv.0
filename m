Sorry I meant feature parity with ACPI and didn't refer to the mechanics.

Sounds good. One of the reason for making it *optional* property is for
backward compatibility. But we should be able to deal with that even with
node.

Not 100% sure, the only multi threaded core in the market I know is
Cavium TX2 which is ACPI.
