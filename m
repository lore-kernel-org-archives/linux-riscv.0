This feels odd. It means that you cannot have the following sequence:

	local_irq_disable();
	enable_irq(x); // where x is owned by a remote hart

as smp_call_function_single() requires interrupts to be enabled.

More fundamentally, why are you trying to make these interrupts look
global while they aren't? arm/arm64 have similar restrictions with GICv2
and earlier, and treats these interrupts as per-cpu.

Given that the drivers that deal with drivers connected to the per-hart
irqchip are themselves likely to be aware of the per-cpu aspect, it
would make sense to align things (we've been through that same
discussion about the clocksource driver a few weeks back).

Thanks,
