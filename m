> Subject: [PATCH v8 00/13] Support PPTT for ARM64
> 
> ACPI 6.2 adds the Processor Properties Topology Table (PPTT), which is
used to
> describe the processor and cache topology. Ideally it is used to
extend/override
> information provided by the hardware, but right now ARM64 is entirely
> dependent on firmware provided tables.
> 
> This patch parses the table for the cache topology and CPU topology.
> When we enable ACPI/PPTT for arm64 we map the package_id to the PPTT
> node flagged as the physical package by the firmware.
> This results in topologies that match what the remainder of the system
expects.
> Finally, we update the scheduler MC domain so that it generally reflects
the
> LLC unless the LLC is too large for the NUMA domain (or package).
> 
> For example on juno:
> [root at mammon-juno-rh topology]# lstopo-no-graphics
>   Package L#0
>     L2 L#0 (1024KB)
>       L1d L#0 (32KB) + L1i L#0 (32KB) + Core L#0 + PU L#0 (P#0)

> 
> v7->v8:
> Modify the logic used to select the MC domain (the change
>   shouldn't modify the sched domains on any existing machines
>   compared to v7, only how they are built) Reduce the severity of some
parsing
> messages.
> Fix s390 link problem.
> Further checks to deal with broken PPTT tables.
> Various style tweaks, SPDX license addition, etc.
> 
> v6->v7:
> Add additional patch to use the last cache level within the NUMA
>   or socket as the MC domain. This assures the MC domain is
>   equal or smaller than the DIE.
> 
> Various formatting/etc review comments.
> 
> Rebase to 4.16rc2
> 
> v5->v6:
> Add additional patches which re-factor how the initial DT code sets
>   up the cacheinfo structure so that its not as dependent on the
>   of_node stored in that tree. Once that is done we rename it
>   for use with the ACPI code.
> 
> Additionally there were a fair number of minor name/location/etc
>   tweaks scattered about made in response to review comments.
> 
> v4->v5:
> Update the cache type from NOCACHE to UNIFIED when all the cache
>   attributes we update are valid. This fixes a problem where caches
>   which are entirely created by the PPTT don't show up in lstopo.
> 
> Give the PPTT its own firmware_node in the cache structure instead of
>   sharing it with the of_node.
> 
> Move some pieces around between patches.
