Yes, with this code the timer interrupt does not show up in
/proc/interrupts.  I wonder if that is an issue and if there is any
precedence for it?

This doesn't really look like 'the future' version but a proposal for
something more like low end realtime microcontrollers ala ARM Cortex M*.
At least the priorities don't really make much sense for a general
purpose SOC.

Either way the existing architectural scause/sie interrupt handling will
remain but can be opted out, but if we really want to support the CLIC
it would have to grow a new irqchip driver, and the PLIC driver would
require a few dozend new lines of glue code to chain underneath it.
