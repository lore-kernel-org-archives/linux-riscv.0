Let's restrict ourselves to the open-source IP for now, as versioning the 
closed source stuff is a bit of a different problem -- when everyone can see 
the source it's easier because we can all agree on exactly what a version 
string means.

For the closed source stuff we currently have just the chip-specific strings, 
as all that stuff is very chip specific (all sorts of special clocking 
constraints).  Essentially you'll have to just trust us as to what's compatible 
with what -- FWIW, since this is mostly driven by the chip process we really 
just have to trust the hardware designers, so we're kind of in the same boat 
(though we can at least peek under the covers if we want to).  Any versioning 
scheme here is doubly complicated because it's closed source and it's chip 
specific, so trying to match this up with the open source stuff seems like too 
much work.

For now we can at least get everyone on the same page as to how we're 
versioning the open-source blocks, which is more important because anyone can 
build a chip with those so we need a well defined scheme.
