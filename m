Yes, Linus was wondering the same thing earlier.  It does run into a couple
issues.  First, only x86 and powerpc implement static_call properly; everywhere
else it's just an indirect call.  Second, there's often some code shared above
the level at which we'd like to do the dispatch.  For example, consider crc32_le
on x86.  If we expand the CRC_PCLMUL macro and inline crc32_le_arch and
crc32_le_base as the compiler does, crc32_le ends up as:

    u32 crc32_le(u32 crc, const u8 *p, size_t len)
    {
            if (len >= 16 && static_branch_likely(&have_pclmulqdq) &&
                crypto_simd_usable()) {
                    const void *consts_ptr;

                    consts_ptr = crc32_lsb_0xedb88320_consts.fold_across_128_bits_consts;
                    kernel_fpu_begin();
                    crc = static_call(crc32_lsb_pclmul)(crc, p, len, consts_ptr);
                    kernel_fpu_end();
                    return crc;
            }
            while (len--)
                    crc = (crc >> 8) ^ crc32table_le[(crc & 255) ^ *p++];
            return crc;
    }

The existing static_call selects between 3 different assembly functions, all of
which require a kernel-mode FPU section and only support len >= 16.

We could instead unconditionally do a static_call upon entry to the function,
with 4 possible targets.  But then we'd have to duplicate the kernel FPU
begin/end sequence in 3 different functions.  Also, it would add an extra
function call for the case where 'len < 16', which is a common case and is
exactly the case where per-call overhead matters the most.

However, if we could actually inline the static call into the *callers* of
crc32_le(), that would make it more worthwhile.  I'm not sure that's possible,
though, especially considering that this code is tristate.

Anyway, this is tangential to this patchset.  Though the new way the code is
organized does make it more feasible to have e.g. a centralized static_call in
the future if we choose to go in that direction.
