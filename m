Speaking as a DT binding maintainer, please avoid OS-specific DT
bindings wherever possible.

While DT bindings live in the kernel tree, they are not intended to be
Linux-specific, and other OSs (e.g. FreeBSD, zephyr) are aiming to
support the same bindings.

In general, targeting a specific OS is a bad idea, because the
implementation details of that OS change over time, or the bindings end
up being tailored to one specific use-case. Exposing details to the OS
such that the OS can make decisions at runtime is typically better.

There is nothing OS-specific about cpu-map, and it may be of use to
other OSs.

The cpu-map binding is not intended to be Linux specific, and avoids
Linux-specific terminology.

While the cpu-map binding documentation is in the Linux source tree, the
binding itseld is not intended to be Linux-specific, and it deliberately
avoids Linux implementation details.

Given clusters can be nested, as in the very first example, I don't see
what prevents multiple levels of shared resources.

Can you please given an example of the topology your considering? Does
that share some resources across clusters at some level?

We are certainly open to improving the cpu-map binding.

Thanks,
Mark.
