> Sorry for bringing up the same discussion. My aim was just to reiterate 
the suggestion you made on the other other thread (i.e. PLIC compatible 
strings) and use the same format used in PLIC block. As these IP 
blocks(pwm & gpio) are also from SiFive for the same Soc (HiFive 
Unleashed board), I was just trying to clarify that this driver also 
follows the exact same convention adopted for PLIC IP block.
