Yes, the v4+ restriction is to meet the requirement of existence of
IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_STATUS_SET MSR which is needed to restore the guest
global_ctrl.

VM_EXIT_SAVE_IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL is introduced from SPR and later. I
remember the original requirements includes to support Skylake and Icelake,
but I ever thought there were some offline sync and the requirement changed...

My bad, I should double confirm this at then.

Yes, xxx_atomic_switch_msr() helpers need to be cleaned up and optimized. I
suppose we can have an independent patch-set to clean up and support
global_ctrl with auto-store list for Skylake and Icelake.
