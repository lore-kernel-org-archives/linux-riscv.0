> 
> ACPI 6.2 adds the Processor Properties Topology Table (PPTT), which is
used to
> describe the processor and cache topology. Ideally it is used to
extend/override
> information provided by the hardware, but right now ARM64 is entirely
> dependent on firmware provided tables.
> 
> This patch parses the table for the cache topology and CPU topology.
> When we enable ACPI/PPTT for arm64 we map the physical_id to the PPTT
> node flagged as the physical package by the firmware.
> This results in topologies that match what the remainder of the system
expects.
> To avoid inverted scheduler domains we then set the MC domain equal to the
> largest cache within the socket below the NUMA domain.

Tested this series and looks good

Tested by: Vijaya Kumar K <vkilari@codeaurora.org>
> 
> v6->v7:
> Add additional patch to use the last cache level within the NUMA
>   or socket as the MC domain. This assures the MC domain is
>   equal or smaller than the DIE.
> 
> Various formatting/etc review comments.
> 
> Rebase to 4.16rc2
> 
> v5->v6:
> Add additional patches which re-factor how the initial DT code sets
>   up the cacheinfo structure so that its not as dependent on the
>   of_node stored in that tree. Once that is done we rename it
>   for use with the ACPI code.
> 
> Additionally there were a fair number of minor name/location/etc
>   tweaks scattered about made in response to review comments.
> 
> v4->v5:
> Update the cache type from NOCACHE to UNIFIED when all the cache
>   attributes we update are valid. This fixes a problem where caches
>   which are entirely created by the PPTT don't show up in lstopo.
> 
> Give the PPTT its own firmware_node in the cache structure instead of
>   sharing it with the of_node.
> 
> Move some pieces around between patches.
