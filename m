This can also be taken care in HLIC driver probe function with something
like below:

if (parent)
return 0;

if (of_is_compatible(parent, "riscv,cpu")) {
/*
* Legacy DT binding so we have HLIC DT node
* under each CPU DT node. To provide backwared
* compatiblity we go forward for only one HLIC
* DT node
*/
if (atomic_inc_return(&hlic_lottery) > 1)
return 0;
}

In PLIC driver probe, register nested IRQ handler for only first two
entries of interrupts-extended because it is HLIC IRQs are per-CPU. We
can happily ignore other entries in interrupts-extended of Legacy DTS.

Biggest plus is the ability show stats for per-CPU interrupts via
"cat /proc/interrupts" (just like other architectures).

Currently, we have only three per-CPU interrupts (timer, software,
and external) but in-future people might come-up with interesting
devices which might have per-CPU interrupts.

I believe it possible to have RICV HLIC driver which maintains
backward compatibility with legacy DTS. I haven't tried above
approach myself on QEMU so I will let you decide.
