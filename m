Agreed. My intention was to keep it simple at first go.
If package node is added, that would work for us as well.

To my ears, it felt a better name. But I don't mind dropping it in favor 
of cpu-map if we are going to standardize cpu-map for both ARM & RISC-V.

IMHO, ARM topology can be reworked and put it in a common place so that 
RISC-V can leverage that.

My intention for this RFC patch was to start the ball rolling on cpu 
topology in RISC-V and see if DT approach is fine with everybody. I 
would be happy to see ARM code to move it to a common code base where 
RISC-V can reuse it.
