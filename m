Scheduler domain topology is already getting all the hints in the 
following way.

static struct sched_domain_topology_level default_topology[] = {
#ifdef CONFIG_SCHED_SMT
         { cpu_smt_mask, cpu_smt_flags, SD_INIT_NAME(SMT) },
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_SCHED_MC
         { cpu_coregroup_mask, cpu_core_flags, SD_INIT_NAME(MC) },
#endif
         { cpu_cpu_mask, SD_INIT_NAME(DIE) },
         { NULL, },
};

#ifdef CONFIG_SCHED_SMT
static inline const struct cpumask *cpu_smt_mask(int cpu)
{
         return topology_sibling_cpumask(cpu);
}
#endif

const struct cpumask *cpu_coregroup_mask(int cpu)
{
         return &cpu_topology[cpu].core_sibling;
}

I agree that naming could have been better in the past. But it is what 
it is now. I don't see any big advantages in this approach compared to 
the existing approach where DT specifies what hardware looks like and 
scheduler sets up it's domain based on different cpumasks.
