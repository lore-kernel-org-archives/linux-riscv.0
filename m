What are the PLIC to HLIC connections you need to support? 1-to-1 is 
easy. But I would imagine you'd want the PLIC irq to go to all the HLICs 
which can't really be described unless you list every CPU's HLIC in 
PLIC "interrupts" property.

We avoid this problem on ARM because a single DT interrupt controller 
node represents even per cpu interrupts and interrupt cells are used to 
indicate which CPU interrupts are routed too. That's not perfect either, 
but seems to be good enough (though maybe Marc Z or Mark R have more 
thoughts on that).

Kind of vague. There's only one implementation and one set of bugs?
