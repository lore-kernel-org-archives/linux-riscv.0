That sounds good, yes. The same change would need to go into
of_platform_default_populate_init() then.

Sure, I was only thinking of the case where there are both
sysfb (from Arm/riscv UEFI) and simpledrm (from devicetree)
objects referring to the same one, not the simpledrm
device created by sysfb_simplefb.

Yes, I saw that as well and don't have an immediate idea for how
to best do it. I saw that you already abstracted the access to
the screen_info members in drm_sysfb_screen_info.c, which I think
is a step in that direction.

I also noticed that efidrm is mostly a subset of vesadrm, so
in theory they could be merged back into an x86 drm driver
along with the drm_sysfb_screen_info helpers, and have a non-x86
driver that constructs a drm_sysfb_device directly from the
EFI structures.

You mean the code from include/linux/screen_info.h? I think
it would make sense to have an x86 specific version of that
to operate on the x86 screen_info, and a simpler version
that just updates the resource for the efirdrm driver, but
that could also be done one level higher or lower.

I'm still not following, sorry. efi-earlycon doesn't require
CONFIG_SYSFB today, and I don't see why that would need to change,
or why it couldn't just 'select SYSFB' if it it does change.

You said that SYSFB_SIMPLEFB should get phased out in the future,
right?

I'm also missing your plan for CONFIG_FIRMWARE_EDID. I only
see three legacy drivers using the old fb_firmware_edid()
interface, so I assume this is not what you are interested in. 

For the global copy that is filled by x86 and efi, and
consumed by vesadrm and efidrm, does that even need to
be a configuration option rather than get always enabled?
