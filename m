Indeed the "workaround" I've suggested off-list for JH-7110 U-Boot
builds where deprecated StarFive loader functionality is required has
been to one-liner patch out the U-Boot build system filtering of
devicetree for SPL build. There is excess SRAM capacity on JH-7110 SoC
and it is not any problem of code size. There cannot be any complaint
about missing nodes if none are missing.

More the reason to regard all StarFive loader affected configuration
related nodes as likely that the SPL would need any of them at that
phase. If you're expert enough to know to just hit specific clocks and
GPIO and controller IP configuration without knowledge of the StarFive
loader then I of course accept that determination on whether this is
achieving the stated purpose of the patch to leverage the StarFive
loader "SD boot" method and U-Boot SPL loading U-Boot Main payload and
then from there Linux-as-usual. I do not have that expertise so the
generalized approach is add filtering hints for anything StarFive loader.

Yes, board reference photos show the multi-select DIP switch. No
schematic available (NDA restricted).

There's transistor logic to select 0b00 or 0b11 RGPIO state from a pin
routed through one of the board interconnects, labeled nRPI_BOOT; not
possible to select those 0b01 and 0b10 StarFive loader mmc modes so (to
the best of my understanding) any MMC action in U-Boot SPL will
originate from StarFive loader non-MMC configuring modes, and there
would be a clean slate except maybe some of the clocks? I'm not sure of
the details from code.

Some revisions of Milk-V Mars have the multi-select switch populated.
Most revisions have a button with transistor logic for override of
multi-select switch to initiate StarFive loader UART serial method. Some
have both a button and a multi-select switch. The default in the absence
of populated parts is StarFive loader SPI NOR method.

Having MMC at SPL time seems appropriate for Milk-V Mars of any revision
because the interfaces are wired up and U-Boot SPL i.e. could be
compiled to load U-Boot Main from MMC when originated from e.g. StarFive
loader UART mode, but the goal of this patch as-is specifically
originates from StarFive loader "SD boot" selection.

I think these are swapped for SDIO WiFi functionality? Not exactly sure,
I never end up with this board to test myself even though I handled the
patch submission with schematic as reference.

It has a UART boot button in photos and schematic, not any multi-select
switch.

Yes, all revisions are with an multi-select switch, and sd where
StarFive loader expects it to be.

It has a UART boot button and a fastboot jumper position which uses the
"user LED" RGPIO3 as an input;  StarFive loader doesn't have anything
about fastboot or RGPIO3 so that specific feature is a vendor U-Boot
configuration.

If we're focused on the "SD boot" feature yes I want that to be
per-board, as it is unknown if the errata is a reference layout and
component selection issue or if it is a BootROM code bug. If the former
then that may vary between boards.

I'd rather regard the StarFive loader code listing as the minimum
baseline of adding filtering hints and we can then totally ignore
per-board hinting and testing of StarFive loader functionality and
external SPL behavior. It is configured in the StarFive loader? Set a
filtering hint and get out of the way of SPL re-configuring the same.

My initial approach to homogenize bootph-pre-ram hinting and nodes
between U-Boot and Linux for JH-7110 SoC was simple trial-and-error only
adding nodes if they result in getting further along in the boot
process. The questions I had then about "SD boot" and "eMMC boot"
StarFive loader mode errata have only really been clarified by digging
into the code listing of the StarFive loader, and at that not
satisfactorily as of yet. What is all this secureboot logic doing? What
are the technical details of the "SD boot" errata? Where is the
published source available for this GPL2.0+ derived code of StarFive loader?

I agree it should not make any difference what StarFive loader does
preceding the SPL phase for these filtering hints but we just don't know
for sure what the "SD boot" errata is, if it's an electrical layout
thing per-board or MMC initialization code incompatibility. I can see
how we might test MMC functionality to U-Boot SPL with adding these
filtering hints but the test methodology does not involve "SD boot" mode
of StarFive loader as that clobbers the configuration and I wouldn't
know if that's invalidating the testing methodology or not. If it is
specific to "SD boot" mode but then splat over the whole range of boards
untested that just does not inspire any confidence given the vendor
response and what is verifiable.
