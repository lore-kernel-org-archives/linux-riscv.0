Yeah, I think we need to find some good balance here that's not quite
established. I think there's good use in having some sort of superset
of DT bindings for a platform in-tree, maybe for a reference board or
similar that customers often create derivatives from, and then find a
good place for derivative DT contents out of tree. The same applies to
defconfigs, where I think the ARM64 approach of a superset of "can
boot everywhere" is useful, and if someone wants to create more
limited configs for their use case they would be free to do so.

That's really cool, thanks for sharing.

Having a place to collect lint/build/test results like this is
something I've been missing and it seems like patchwork is doing a
pretty good job there. One of the things that I'm getting excited
about is to have a shared place to collect all these signals before
patches are reviewed and applied (or pull requests merged) without
necessarily adding a lot of potentially noisy email generation.
