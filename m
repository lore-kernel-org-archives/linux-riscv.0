For this specific case IIUC it's the same as bad_area.  VM_FAULT_BADMAP is
further handled later in do_page_fault() there for either arm/arm64.

This reminded me this, on how arm defines the private retvals, while the
generic ones grows and probably no one noticed they can collapse already..

#define VM_FAULT_BADMAP		0x010000
#define VM_FAULT_BADACCESS	0x020000

enum vm_fault_reason {
        ...
	VM_FAULT_HINDEX_MASK    = (__force vm_fault_t)0x0f0000,
};

VM_FAULT_HINDEX_MASK is only used by VM_FAULT_HWPOISON_LARGE, so I think
arm[64] could expect some surprise when it hit hugetlb hwpoison pages...
maybe I should prepare a patch for arm.

For this one, I don't think they can be mixed.  IMHO RETRY only binds with
a wait, so if we didn't wait and found issue, we return ERROR; if we
decided to wait, we will try nothing more besides return after wait with
the RETRY.  We should just never check any error at all if the wait
happened.  Otherwise there's a bug of potential deadlock.

I'll skip some details in this email either above or below; I agree
there're so many trivial details to take care of to not break a thing.

IMHO it'll be merely impossible to merge things across most (if not to say,
all) archs.  It will need to be start from one or at least a few that still
shares a major common base - I would still rely on x86 as a start - then we
try to use the helper in as much archs as possible.

Even on x86, I do also see challenges so I'm not sure whether a common
enough routine can be abstracted indeed.  But I believe there's a way to do
this because obviously we still see tons of duplicated logics falling
around.  It may definitely need time to think out where's the best spot to
start, and how to gradually move towards covering more archs starting from
one.
