Ya, sorry about that.  FWIW, we don't consider any of the bindings stable until 
they're actually accepted upstream, so it's on us to fix our bootloaders to 
match what actually lands upstream.  Luckily there's not that much hardware out 
there and none of it is in production, so I'm OK forcing people to upgrade 
bootloaders to make this all work.

I think it's probably best to leave the extra compat string out of the kernel 
proper, as then it'll never be enshrined as a RISC-V standard.

Again, sorry about that :).  The RISC-V platform specification really should 
have started a year ago, but I'm afraid there's just a bit too much going on on 
my end.

If it helps any, we just submitted a plumbers dev room with one topic being the 
RISC-V platform spec, so I guess I'm in official trouble now it there isn't at 
least something to talk about by November...
