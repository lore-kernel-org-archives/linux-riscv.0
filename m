It is ACPI only in the production configuration.  I suppose we could 
hack things up to do basic DT sanity, but I expect it would be nasty and 
non-trivial.

On a cursory glance, it looks like some of the reorganized code would 
also be used in the ACPI path (things that are common between DT and 
ACPI).  I do not expect problems, but I still feel its prudent to do a 
sanity check on actual hardware.
