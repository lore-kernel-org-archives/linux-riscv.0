I think that's the right response.  It's why all the feedback from people
who haven't even tried to follow the fault path (eg the session at LSFMM)
is completely useless.  The fault path is WAY TOO COMPLEX.  I'll have
more to say on this in two weeks at Plumbers.

I think these two are the same case?  At least by my reading, case 2
also waits for the folio to be unlocked (ie the read completed).
do_sync_mmap_readahead() doesn't do that, but we then call
__filemap_get_folio() which shuld return the appropriate folio,
then we call __folio_lock_killable() or __folio_lock().

Oh, yeah, that's icky.  Hadn't even crawled onto my list of problems
with this function.

This one really is my fault / Suren's fault / your fault ;-)

We should not have overloaded VM_FAULT_RETRY for this case.  We should
have had a distinct VM_FAULT_NEEDS_MMAP_LOCK code.  But I am *scared*
to try to separate the two at this point.  It was hard to make sure we
got all the cases as we pushed it down, and now it's going to be worse.

But I don't think that hugetlb_fault() deserves any stick here:
         * We must check to release the per-VMA lock. __vmf_anon_prepare() in
         * hugetlb_wp() is the only way ret can be set to VM_FAULT_RETRY.
is the comment on the only two mentions of VM_FAULT_RETRY in hugetlb.

I do have a plan to get rid of those two mentions actually ...
but let's talk about in in Prague.

I find it really hard to reason about uffd.

That's just wrong.  It turns the pagefault path into a spin on
the inode lock!

I think your AI is confused.  I don't see how nfs_vm_page_mkwrite()
can return VM_FAULT_LOCKED | VM_FAULT_RETRY.  Nor netfs.  Orangefs
is wrong and needs to be fixed ... once I figure out what it actually
wants.

That's probably OK.  I think?

There's also the VM_FAULT_COMPLETED insanity ...

I think there's a bathtub with a baby in it over there ...

There's considerable scope for simplification here.
lock_folio_maybe_drop_mmap() makes my eyeballs bleed every time I look
at it.  But we do need smoe kind of restart-the-fault mechanism.

We desperately need to move more of the fault handling path out of the
architectures.

Thanks for dragging me back into this ;-)
