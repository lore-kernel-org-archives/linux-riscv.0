Ah, thank you so much.  This is great!  With this patch set applied on top of 
rc7 I can boot QEMU master and get to the Fedora root file system.  I'll review 
the patch set properly, but at least for now I think a

is warranted.  What's the best way to go about merging this?  There's quite a 
bit of arch/riscv diff here so I don't mind taking it through the RISC-V tree, 
but there's also some irqchip and clocksource stuff as well so I'm not sure if 
that's OK to do.
