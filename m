agree, to distinguish the user input one and the kernel accepted one. If want
to reserve ARCH as the default Kernel ARCH, what about use something like UARCH
(User input ARCH) or XARCH (eXtended ARCH), it is shorter than VARIANT.

    # UARCH and ARCH mapping, ARCH is supported by kernel, UARCH is input from user
    UARCH_riscv      = riscv64
    UARCH           ?= $(or $(UARCH_$(ARCH)),$(ARCH))
    
    ARCH_riscv32     = riscv
    ARCH_riscv64     = riscv
    ARCH            ?= $(or $(ARCH_$(UARCH)),$(UARCH)

With this, we can simply customize the variables with UARCH or XARCH and left
the others as before.

We can delay this after the minimal config patchset, I'm still preparing the v2
of the tinyconfig patchset, it is almost ready. these two have some conflicts.

With the v2 tinyconfig patchset, we are able to run nolibc-test for different
architectures independently.
