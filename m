Good to hear.

While cpu-map doesn't contain that information today, we can *add* that
information to the cpu-map binding if necessary.

Hold on. Rather than reinventing things from first principles, can we
please discuss what you want to *achieve*, i.e. what information you
need?

Having a node is not a significant cost, and there are reasons we may
want thread nodes. For example, it means that we can always refer to any
level of topology with a phandle, and we might want to describe
thread-affine devices in future.

There are a tonne of existing bindings that are ugly, but re-inventing
them for taste reasons alone is more costly to the ecosystem than simply
using the existing bindings. We avoid re-inventing bindings unless there
is a functional problem e.g. cases which they cannot possibly describe.

FWIW, given this is arguably topological, I'm not personally averse to
describing this in the cpu-map, if that actually gains us more than the
complexity require to support it.

Given we don't do this for device power domains, I suspect that it's
simpler to stick with the existing binding.

The cpu-map was intended to expose topological dtails, and this isn't
really a topological property. For example, Arm DynamIQ systems can have
heterogeneous CPUs within clusters.

I do not think it's worth moving this, tbh.

Is there a strong gain from moving this?

Not knowing much about the hardware, I can't really say.

I'm not sure I follow why the distinction between a cluster and a core
is non-sensical. A cluster is always a collection of cores.

A hart could be a core in its own right, or it could be a thread under a
core, which shares functional units with other harts within that core.

Arguably, we could have mandated that the topology always needed to
describe down to a thread, even if a core only had a single thread. That
ship has sailed, however.

Thanks,
Mark.
