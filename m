Subject: [RFC 0/3] Unify CPU topology across ARM64 & RISC-V 
Message-ID: <1541728209-3224-1-git-send-email-atish.patra@wdc.com>

The cpu-map DT entry in ARM64 can describe the CPU topology in
much better way compared to other existing approaches. RISC-V can
easily adopt this binding to represent it's own CPU topology.
Thus, both cpu-map DT binding and topology parsing code can be
moved to a common location so that RISC-V or any other
architecture can leverage that.

The relevant discussion regarding unifying cpu topology can be
found in [1].

arch_topology seems to be a perfect place to move the common
code. I have not introduced any functional changes in the moved
to code. The only downside in this approach is that the capacity
code will be executed for RISC-V as well. But, it will exit
immediately after not able to find the appropriate DT node. If
the overhead is considered too much, we can always compile out
capacity related functions under a different config for the
architectures that do not support them.

The patches have been tested for RISC-V and compile tested for
ARM64.

The socket changes[2] can be merged on top of this series or vice
versa.
