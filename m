It is what it is, you've only got so much time :)

Yah, I prefer anything that doesn't have ternarys in it.

I thought you were doing one at FOSDEM!

I'd rather the maths was right. Fixing it up front is better than trying
to debug it from a customer complaint - so thanks for that.
And the maths was very naive to begin with, although I only submitted it
in the summer, I think I wrote the driver prior to having upstreamed a
single patch, and I think that showed in the maths.

I dunno. I feel bad if I do that too - but if the problem you didn't
notice earlier on is a bug, rather than some sort of style comment, I
don't see why you wouldn't call it out.

Or that it was poor to begin with & barely improved over time...

I wasn't really blaming you for the number of revisions, the number of
silly mistakes I've made really irritates me.

Thanks,
Conor.
