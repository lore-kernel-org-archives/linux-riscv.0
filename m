Two things:

 1) Upstream's "requirements" are not the same as Google's requirements (or those
    of any company/individual).  Upstream most definitely is influenced by the
    needs and desires of end users, but ultimately the decision to do something
    (or not) is one that needs to be made by the upstream community.

 2) Decisions made off-list need to be summarized and communicated on-list,
    especially in cases like this where it's a relatively minor detail in a
    large series/feature, and thus easy to overlook.

I'll follow-up internally to make sure these points are well-understood by Google
folks as well (at least, those working on KVM).

Eh, this was a group "effort".  I'm as much to blame as anyone else.

No need, as above, Google's requirements (assuming the requirements you're referring
to are coming from Google people) are effectively just one data point.  At this
point, I want to drive the decision to support Sylake+ (or not) purely through
discussion of upstream patches.

I have the code written (I wanted to see how much complexity it would add before
re-opening this discussion).  My plan is to put the Skylake+ support at the end
of the series, not a separate series, so that it can be reviewed in one shot.
E.g. if we can make a change in the "main" series that would simplify Skylake+
support, then I'd prefer to find and implement any such change right away.
