I don't like the name much.  To me, memblocks_present means "are
memblocks present" whereas this actually means "memblocks are present".
But whatever.  A little covering comment which describes what this

I can grab both patches and shall sneak them into 4.20-rcX, but feel
free to merge them into some git tree if you'd prefer.  If I see them
turn up in linux-next I shall drop my copy.
