Willy, it is not about alignment, just rechecked it, it is code indent
related:

    #32: FILE: tools/include/nolibc/arch-mips.h:160:
    +^I                                                                      \$
    
    ERROR: code indent should use tabs where possible
    #44: FILE: tools/include/nolibc/arch-mips.h:172:
    +^I          "t0", "t1", "t2", "t3", "t4", "t5", "t6", "t7", "t8", "t9"  \$

The first one is here:

	register long _arg6 = (long)(arg6);                                   \
	<--     whitespaces                                                -->\
	__asm__  volatile (                                                   \

And the second one:

		: "memory", "cc", "at", "v1", "hi", "lo",                     \
	<-spaces->"t0", "t1", "t2", "t3", "t4", "t5", "t6", "t7", "t8", "t9"  \

These two lines indent with "one tab + more than 8 whitespaces", the
other lines also have whitespaces code indent, but not more than 8, so,
not reported.

I have tried to replace whitespaces with tabs in the first one, but the first
one can not align with the other lines, so, the current modify method is
applied.

To only touch minimal lines, this may work (reserve the post-whitespaces):

    $ sed -i -e '/^\t*        /{s/        /\t/g}' tools/include/nolibc/arch-*.h

It will only fix up the lines the reported. The cleanup of the post-whitespaces
is not necessary and it does touch too many lines.

Sorry to disturb you with such cleanups, since I have seen the similar
reports when we added the arch-arm.h (for my_syscall6), because the code
style aligns with the others, so, I did touch it, but again encounter
the same issues with arch-mips.h and to avoid the future reports, I
checked the whole arch-xxx.h, and found more such reports, so, we
prepared such a patch.

To be honest, I do prefer post-tabs to whitespaces (less key press, less code
size ;-)), but as you pointed out, post-tabs have more side-effects, we
shouldn't touch them, Thanks.

Ok, will split it to a standalone patch, one error report one patch.

Agree, let's keep it as before.

Thanks,
