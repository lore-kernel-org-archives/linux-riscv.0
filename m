This series adds the counter delegation extension support. It is based on
very early PoC work done by Kevin Xue and mostly rewritten after that.
The counter delegation ISA extension(Smcdeleg/Ssccfg) actually depends
on multiple ISA extensions.

1. S[m|s]csrind : The indirect CSR extension[1] which defines additional
   5 ([M|S|VS]IREG2-[M|S|VS]IREG6) register to address size limitation of
   RISC-V CSR address space.
2. Smstateen: The stateen bit[60] controls the access to the registers
   indirectly via the above indirect registers.
3. Smcdeleg/Ssccfg: The counter delegation extensions[2]

The counter delegation extension allows Supervisor mode to program the
hpmevent and hpmcounters directly without needing the assistance from the
M-mode via SBI calls. This results in a faster perf profiling and very
few traps. This extension also introduces a scountinhibit CSR which allows
to stop/start any counter directly from the S-mode. As the counter
delegation extension potentially can have more than 100 CSRs, the specification
leverages the indirect CSR extension to save the precious CSR address range.

Due to the dependency of these extensions, the following extensions must be
enabled in qemu to use the counter delegation feature in S-mode.

"smstateen=true,sscofpmf=true,ssccfg=true,smcdeleg=true,smcsrind=true,sscsrind=true"
or Virt machine users can just "max" cpu instead.

When we access the counters directly in S-mode, we also need to solve the
following problems.

1. Event to counter mapping
2. Event encoding discovery

The RISC-V ISA doesn't define any standard either for event encoding or the
event to counter mapping rules. Until now, the SBI PMU implementation relies
on device tree binding[3] to discover the event to counter mapping in RISC-V
platform in the firmware. The SBI PMU specification[4] defines event encoding
for standard perf events as well. Thus, the kernel can query the appropriate
counter for an given event from the firmware.

However, the kernel doesn't need any firmware interaction for hardware
counters if counter delegation is available in the hardware. Thus, the driver
needs to discover the above mappings/encodings by itself without any assistance
from firmware.

Solution to Problem #1:
This patch series solves the above problem #1 by extending the perf tool in a
way so that event json file can specify the counter constraints of each event
and that can be passed to the driver to choose the best counter for a given
event.

This series introduces a RISC-V specific event field in "CounterIDMask" in
event_fields that describes a bitmask of counters supported for a specific eventi.
This is the similar approach for few other existing properties in the event_fields
which were used by single architecture as well. The counter constraint bitmap is
passed to the perf driver via newly introduced "counterid_mask" property set in "config2".

The platform vendor have these three ways to encode/use the platform specific
events.

1. Directly in driver with appropriate constraints (discouraged due to bloating
of the driver)
2. Encode in Json with with CounterIDMask field (preferred as it is contained
within platform specific json file)
3. Directly pass counterid_mask at while invoking perf 
cpu/event=<code>,counterid_mask=<mask>/

The last two patches show cases these use cases and not intended for merging.

Solution to problem #2:

The event encoding can come from the json or commandline as well.

The Qemu patches are available in upstream now.

Signed-off-by: Atish Patra <atishp@meta.com>

Changes in v7:
- Fixed various issues pointed by Sashiko. 
- Rebased on top of v7.1
- Added a separate patch to fix various memory leak issues in probe error path
- Link to v6: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20260608-counter_delegation-v6-0-285b72ed65a9@meta.com

Changes in v6:
- Reverted the file name changes as suggested by Will. Now pmu-sbi.c will continue
  to support both counter delegation and SBI PMU with different function prefixes.
- No longer depends up old upstream patch for reusing the Counter property to
  encode event to counter mapping property. It directly uses additional field in
  json event fields similar to other architectures.
- Added few test patches (not intended for upstreaming) to show case different
  possibilities of providing mapping/event encodings.
- Fixed review comments and miscellenous minor typos/fixes on v5
- Rebased on top of v7.1-rc6

Changes in v5:
- Fixed dt_binding_check errors.
- Added the ISA extension dependancy for counter delegation extensions.
- Replaced the boolean variables with static key conditional check required at boot time.
- Miscellaneous minor code restructuring.
- Link to v4: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250205-counter_delegation-v4-0-835cfa88e3b1@rivosinc.com

Changes in v4:
- Added ISA dependencies as per dt schema instead of description.
- Fixed few compilation issues due to patch reordering in v3.
- Link to v3: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250127-counter_delegation-v3-0-64894d7e16d5@rivosinc.com

Changes in v3:
- Fixed the dtb binding check failures.
- Inlcuded the fix reported by Rajnesh Kanwal for guest counter overflow.
- Rearranged the overflow handling more efficiently for better modularity.
- Link to v2: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250114-counter_delegation-v2-0-8ba74cdb851b@rivosinc.com

Changes in v2:
- Dropped architecture specific overrides for event encoding.
- Dropped hwprobe bits.
- Added a vendor specific event encoding table to support vendor specific event
  encoding and counter mapping.
- Fixed few bugs and cleanup.
- Link to v1: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20240217005738.3744121-1-atishp@rivosinc.com
