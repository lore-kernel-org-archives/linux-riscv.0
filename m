Staring at GUP-fast and perf_get_pgtable_size()---which should better be 
converted to pudp_get() etc--I guess we might have to rework 
p4d_offset_lockless() to do something that doesn't rely on
passing variables of local variables.

We might have to enlighten these walkers (and only these) about folded 
page tables such that they don't depend on the result of pudp_get() and 
friends.
