That's no solution. K: exists so that maintainers get Cc'd on patches
that match keywords - for example a subsystem maintainer wants to be
Cc'd on patches that make use of the subsystem interfaces would include
a K: line to pick up on function names that appear in patches.

Disabling K: means that these will be missed.

NIPA has caught several instances where I should have been Cc'd but
haven't because of this facility, and thus patches have not been
properly reviewed. So, disabling K: is detrimental.

IMHO, it's crazy that keywords match any of the email headers present
in a patch that is presented to it. As I've already said - either
get_maintainers should restrict to a limited number of headers used
for matching, or NIPA needs to present to get_maintainers what would
be an original patch as generated by git without lots of email headers.

Sigh. Why is this so damn difficult. I wasn't expecting you to do
anything about it immediately. It's something that _you_ /and/
_Jakub_ as the author of NIPA need to come to some agreement on.
That's why my original email was also sent _to_ Jakub as well.

Sheesh. Again, why is this so difficult????
