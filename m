For the basic clk types I think it would be good to leave the old stuff
alone. We have already split the logic out into helpers, so I wonder if
we can do this better by making kernel modules for the different basic
regmap clk types and exposing registration APIs. If we force drivers
that use the basic regmap types to 'select' the module then we'll make
it so that we don't include code that isn't used anywhere. That's one of
the problems with the basic clk types, it's always built. It also lets
us avoid making regmap a dependency for the clk framework at large.

Doing that would also let us avoid the flag because it will be explicit
in any registration API, clk_register_divider() vs.
clk_register_regmap_divider(). Yes we duplicate some boiler plate logic
around read-only and registration paths, but this is alright as long as
we can share most of the code and gain the advantage of removing the
code entirely when it isn't used.

I wonder if we can even make a regmap on the fly for the iomem pointers
so that clk_divider_readl() can always use the regmap API to access the
hardware. Sounds wasteful but maybe it would work.

We don't need to store the regmap identifier in the struct clk. We can
store it in the 'struct clk_init_data' with some new field, and only do
that when/if we actually need to. We would need to pass the init data to
the clk_ops::init() callback though. We currently knock that out during
registration so that clk_hw->init is NULL. Probably we can just set that
to NULL after the init routine runs in __clk_core_init().

Long story short, don't add something to 'struct clk_core', 'struct
clk', or 'struct clk_hw' for these details. We can have a 'struct
clk_regmap_hw' that everyone else can build upon:

  struct clk_regmap_hw {
        struct regmap *regmap;
        struct clk_hw hw;
  };

and then set the regmap pointer during registration in
clk_hw_init_regmap().

int clk_hw_init_regmap(struct clk_hw *hw)
{
	struct device *dev;
	struct regmap *regmap;
	struct clk_regmap_hw *rhw;

	rhw = clk_hw_to_clk_regmap_hw(hw);

	dev = clk_hw_get_dev(hw);
	if (!dev)
		return -EINVAL;

	regmap = dev_get_regmap(dev, hw->init->regmap_name);
	if (!regmap)
		return -EINVAL; // Print helpful message
	rhw->regmap = regmap;

	return 0;
}

or we can even make it so that there's clk_hw_init_regmap() and
clk_hw_init_regmap_name() so that drivers can have multiple functions if
the clks need different regmaps.

int my_init_regmap(struct clk_hw *hw)
{
	int ret;

	ret = clk_hw_init_regmap_name(hw, "my_name");
	...
}

If you don't need the multiple regmap support then it's fine to punt
here until later.

Of course, doing only what is minimally required is better than changing
everything if you're not sure the approach is going to land.
