This patch is just changing the first argument to the calls. So if we
need to change, it has to be separate patch.

Now, we can use of_property_read_u64() but is there any particular
reason you mention that ? One reason I can see is that we can avoid
making explicit of_get_property call. Just wanted to the motive before I
can write the patch.
