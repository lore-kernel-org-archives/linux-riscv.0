Subject: [PATCH v6 14/16] powerpc: Switch to generic free_initrd_mem.
In-Reply-To: <20180401145931.7932-1-shea@shealevy.com>

List-Id: linux-riscv.lists.infradead.org

The first patch in this series added a weakly-defined generic
implementation, which is functionally identical to the
architecture-specific one removed here.

Series boot-tested on RISC-V (which now uses the generic
implementation) and x86_64 (which doesn't).
