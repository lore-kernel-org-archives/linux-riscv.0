I think the patch is still a little different from 5ce6c1f3535f:

before:
lr.w.aqrl + sc.w.aqrl

5ce6c1f3535f:
lr.w + sc.w.rl + fence

this patch:
lr.w + sc.w.aqrl

Thx for the effort on the patch and so much related history
information which let me clearer.

The motivation of this patch is to save one fence instruction and let
.aqrl give the RCsc synchronization point. We also have used the .aqrl
in ATOMIC_FETCH_OP:
                "       amo" #asm_op "." #asm_type ".aqrl  %1, %2, %0"  \

I think using .aqrl would be better and union into one style in
atomic.h would be clearer.
(Some are .aqrl, some are .rl + fence)
