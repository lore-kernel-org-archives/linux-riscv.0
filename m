Thanks!  Modulo the one device tree issue I replied to in patch 3 this looks 
great!  We've already gotten the ACKs to take this through the RISC-V tree, so 
I'm going to put this along with the queued RISC-V patches on our for-next 
branch, including my proposed change for "sifive,plic-1.0" but leaving the 
device tree bindings with #{address,size}-cells=1.

We can always change this, but I'd like to get this out so people can start 
playing with it earlier rather than later.

Thanks to everyone for all the help!
