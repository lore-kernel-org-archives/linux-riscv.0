I have an idea.
 
Why do we even use/need the GA log?
Why not, just disable the 'guest mode' in the iommu and let it sent good old normal interrupt
when a vCPU is not running, just like we do when we inhibit the AVIC?
 
GA log makes all devices that share an iommu (there are 4 iommus per package these days,
some without useful devices) go through a single (!) msi like interrupt,
which is even for some reason implemented by a threaded IRQ in the linux kernel.
