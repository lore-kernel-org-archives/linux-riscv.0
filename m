Yah, perhaps I cull too aggressively but there's a middle ground ;)

It's Anup's responsibility to provide you with that information, I have
not reproduced this issue, so I won't mislead you with QEMU invocations
that may not be what's required to reproduce.

I think it's not unusual (and desirable?) to start the upstreaming
process for stuff before hardware is publicly available, so that once it
is, support is already upstream, or close to. I do know that people have
tested this series in FPGA based hardware emulation platforms etc.
Posting patches for it also helps avoid duplication of effort between
the various vendors in RISC-V land, who would otherwise have to write
their own drivers. Also, the documented RISC-V policy for accepting
support for ISA stuff says:
	We'll only accept patches for new modules or extensions if the
	specifications for those modules or extensions are listed as being
	unlikely to be incompatibly changed in the future.  For
	specifications from the RISC-V foundation this means "Frozen"
	(Documentation/riscv/patch-acceptance.rst)
AIA (the spec behind the APLIC/IMSIC) is frozen, and qualifies from a
RISC-V point of view. What Marc is willing to accept, in terms of
pre-production hardware support, is up to him obviously!

Cheers,
Conor.
