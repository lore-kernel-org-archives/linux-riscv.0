Yeah, apologies for adding a bunch of cross-coordination this late too.

It's likely going to be conflict-ridden no matter what we do. RISC-V

Tuesday afternoon looks least conflict-y when I squint at the
schedule, or Thursday afternoon (but ideally not overlapping with
Daniel's DRM/gitlab session).
