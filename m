Ah, I must have looked at the wrong examples in the patch series, sorry.

I agree, I overall like this change, just expected to see more global
structures being able to be removed.

I missed the list_head, so yes, this would be better, but don't pass
back the syscore structure, how about just a void * instead, making the
whole container_of() stuff go away?
