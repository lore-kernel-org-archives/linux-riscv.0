Are you aware of any CPU implementation that works like this?

You are correct. However, I believe a retirement barrier would still
already be useful as a stopgap solution as it should still reduce the
success rate and therefore the bandwith of the exploit. Also, because
the verifier currently adds barriers very early (it does not only add
the barrier before the non-CT operation on a secret but already when
anything that is not allowed architecturally happens), it might actually
prevent some exploits. This does of course not offer full protection,
but it still makes it harder to develop working exploits.

Thank you very much. For JH7110 I think it would then be best to avoid
adding anything unless there is any strong evidence showing this CPU is
vulnerable to Spectre v1. (A quick search yielded no result but maybe
someone else has more information on this.) Even if it is vulnerable,
people might want performant unprivileged eBPF simply for compatibility
reasons. As we can not know whether untrusted unprivileged users are
actually a concern, a dmesg warning might be best then. Or maybe there
is some other construct that achieves the desired effect on JH7110.

That would be very useful to eBPF.

Are you aware of any existing RISC-V CPU implementations where FENCE.I,
or any other instruction, does delay issueing/retirement by a few cycles
(e.g., until concurrent stores have completed)? (I am aware that
retirement is not sufficient formally, but it is better than nothing.)
Anything like this might be preferable over simply filling up the
reorder buffer with some NOP instruction. And even if a part of the CPU
state may still be speculative, any such instruction would already be
useful as a (partial) stopgap solution.

Or does FENCE.I do this on any concrete CPU other than JH7110?
