Certainly not. A common doc can make every level optional and each
arch can define what's mandatory.

It's more consistent to make each level a node IMO and we've already
discussed and defined it this way. I don't see how it's really less
code or documentation.

BTW, powerpc defined threads with multiple reg entries in the cpu
nodes. You could do that if you wanted.
