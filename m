I agree.

Makes sense.  I wrote up something quickly

but it's very much a first pass as I managed to confuse myself while writing 
the documentation.  The central issue here is that the "riscv,cpu-intc" on the 
fu540-c000 is actually provided by our machine-mode firmware, so I'm not sure 
calling this "sifive,fu540-c000-cpu-intc" is actually the right thing to do 
here.  It should really be called something like 
"ENTITY,bbl-cpu-intc-537ae11ae506" -- where that's a git hash of the BBL used, 
and I'm not sure what "ENTITY" should be (bbl is part of the RISC-V GitHub, but 
it's not part of any RISC-V spec).
That naming scheme is a nightmare, though, so I don't want to suggest it :).

There's then the additional wrinkle where, in the current BBL implementation, 
we just use the machine-mode hardware trap delegation mechanism to directly 
provide most of the relevant traps to Linux without actually invoking any 
software.  As a result, that means any as-of-yet undiscovered bugs present in 
that particular hardware path will end up manifesting in Linux.  The trouble 
then is that if we discover one of these bugs we'd want to fix it in the 
machine-mode monitor, so the actual behavior of the interrupt controller that 
Linux sees would end up depending on both the hardware implementation as well 
as the machine-mode monitor's implementation.  The resulting naming scheme 
seems crazy.

Maybe the right thing to do here is to just call this something like

    compatible = "sifive,fu540-c000-cpu-intc-0", "riscv,cpu-intc";

which would result in a patch that looks like

With the idea being that at least we can figure out if we end up with a bug 
that can be worked around in software.

Thanks for all the help!
