Hi Aneesh,

I can reproduce the CCA regression discussed in this thread:
  https://lore.kernel.org/all/yq5azeyxyfol.fsf@kernel.org/#t

The guest runs out of SWIOTLB slots, causing disk I/O to fail and
preventing the guest from booting.

I would like to test the fix on real CCA hardware. Could you please Cc
me when you respin the series? I follow LKML, but I may still miss the
posting by chance.

Thanks,
Kohei
