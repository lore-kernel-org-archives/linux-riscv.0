Hi Laurent,

Thank you for taking a look at this!

Such a property would have been a more accurate representation of the
case here, voiding the need of a "oneOf:" clause, and simplifying the
overall binding implementation.

Furthermore, I saw this as a fair opportunity to introduce the new
property because there was only one other dual link panel which used the
original properties.
And, while the code delta shall be same in implementing the pixel-type
property irrespective of the number of existing dual-link panels that
support the original method, I believe with pixel-type, we can set a
fresh precedence for future scenarios (perhaps for "quad-link" LVDS, if
there ever will be one).

Having said that, this was merely a suggestion. If this does not seem to
be a strong enough reason to change the existing system, I can keep
using the original properties (as I have in the patches) and send a v2.

I went through the discussions that you mentioned above. For now, I will
stick to the status-quo that there is for LVDS panels. =)
