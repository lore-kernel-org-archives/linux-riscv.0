For tmp > 0xff00 it may be off by more than 255, but that isn't possible
at this stage as we've already eliminated the possibility above.

tmp =3D 256

*prescale =3D 256 // (254 + 1) - 1
          =E2=89=88 0

*prescale =3D 256 // (prescale + 1) - 1
          =3D 256 / (0 + 1) - 1
	  =3D 255

That's then gonna give us one of the broken configurations from the
limitations.

tmp =3D 257

*prescale =3D 257 // (254 + 1) - 1
          =E2=89=88 0

*prescale =3D 257 // (prescale + 1) - 1
          =3D 257 / (0 + 1) - 1
	  =3D 256
	  =3D 0 (registers are 8-bit)

And so on...

I'm quite obviously missing something that you may think is obvious
here, but is not immediately clear to me.

No worries :)

Pending an explanation of your calculation above, I've gone and done the
rest of these things. I shan't resend until -rc1 or I get an explanation
of your calculation - whichever happens first!
