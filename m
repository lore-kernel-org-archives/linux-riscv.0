We'll drop the trailing 0 since the SoC identifier prefix should be 
sufficiently precise.

As you write, the assumption is that chip integration IP blocks like this 
one are likely to be specific to individual SoCs.

This may not be universally true for SiFive looking into the future, but 
since we don't yet have a clear sense of the extent of exact reuse (i.e. 
chip "families"), am not yet comfortable with advocating something like 
"sifive,prci0" yet, as we do with the sifive-blocks.

Thanks; fixed.
