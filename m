Yes that's basically the gist, it should be a matter of identifying code
that creates the root bus (explicitly or implicitly - ie
pci_scan_root_bus()) and patching it up, probably something to be done
(and moved into -next) early -rc* since it is something that can easily
break the world if we miss some code paths. I will have a look into
that and can take this patch for that series if it does not go into
v4.19.

Thanks,
