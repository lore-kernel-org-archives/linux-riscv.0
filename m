I was about to post a patch to remove the numa check if CONFIG_NUMA 
disabled. But that seems pointless if the its happening with numa 
enabled. So assuming, its the removal of the core from the numa mask 
which is causing problems. It looks like numa_clear_node() might cause 
similar problems when numa is enabled. In my case the problem I see is 
NULL dereference in __bitmap_intersect called from select_task_rq_fair. 
That said, I only see the problem when CONFIG_NUMA isn't set.

So, I've also got another work around which caches the numa node to the 
cpu_topology and then only builds it when store_cpu_topology() is 
called. That should stabilize the numa mask, and assure that the bit 
maps are correct when the scheduler requests them.

Do you guys want that patch, or are we looking for a deeper root cause?
