Thank you for your previous suggestion regarding the use of udev. We have carefully implemented this
approach, but found that while udev can create symbolic links, it doesn't resolve the underlying
issue of device ordering in lsblk output, which remains important for our use case.

In our large-scale server deployment comprising hundreds of machines, the udev approach presents
several operational challenges:
1. Management Complexity: Maintaining per-machine udev rules across our entire infrastructure is not scalable.
2. Customer Workflow Dependencies: Our customers rely on consistent lsblk output and direct device
names for their operational workflows and automated scripts.
3. Scalability Limitations: We use standardized hardware configurations where consistent behavior
should be the default, rather than requiring per-machine customization.

We've noticed that PCIe enumeration order tends to vary across system reboots (for example: first
boot showed PC08->PC06->PC10->PC07->PC11->PC09, while second boot showed
PC09->PC06->PC08->PC11->PC07->PC10), even though the ACPI firmware consistently reports the root
bridge sequence as PC06->PC07->PC08->PC09->PC10->PC11.

In our testing, we found that adjusting the registration priority of the aplic driver seems to help
ensure the interrupt controller initializes before PCI enumeration, leading to more consistent
device ordering.

We'd be grateful for your expert advice on a few questions:
1. Are there any dependencies or implications we might have missed with this priority adjustment?
2. Would you happen to know of any other kernel-level approaches that could help with enumeration ordering?
3. We're curious if there might be any ongoing discussions about making enumeration more
deterministic for standardized server environments?

We fully understand there are good reasons behind the current design, but the variable ordering has
been somewhat challenging for our users. We'd appreciate any guidance you might offer on the best
way forward.

Thank you for your time and valuable insights.

Best regards,
Liqiang
