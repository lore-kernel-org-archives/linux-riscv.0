I updated these to apply on Linus' current master, commit 5472d60c129f, 
cleaned up the checkpatch.pl --strict issues, applied Anup's pr_info() 
suggestion, and pushed them up here to make it convenient for folks to 
integrate and test:

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/pjw/riscv.git/?h=riscv-experimental-for-v6.18

Am assuming you didn't have other changes that you wanted to make; let me 
know if that's not the case.

I noticed that you asked for folks to do additional testing, particularly 
of the SBI PMU driver integration, but didn't notice any additional 
Tested-by:s.  It would be great if other folks on the list could do some 
focused testing now, particularly since we're on v7 of this series, and 
I'm sure others care about this.


thanks,

- Paul
