IIUC, it won't impact anyting; memblock_mark_nodump() only set
the MEMBLOCK_NODUMP bit on the matching memblock.memory regions,
and from the buddy allocator's view, there is nothing changed.

The only effect is the region split you already pointed out: marking
a sub-range costs up to two extra entries in the memblock.memory
region array.
