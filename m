Is there any standard regarding CPU topology on the device tree spec ? 
As far as
I know there is none. We are talking about a Linux-specific Device Tree 
binding
so I don't see why defining a binding for the Linux scheduler is out of 
scope.
Do you have cpu-map on other OSes as well ?

All lists on the cc list are Linux specific, again I don't see your 
point here
are we talking about defining a standard CPU topology scheme for the 
device tree
spec or a Linux-specific CPU topology binding such as cpu-map ?

Even on this case your point is not valid, the information of two harts 
sharing
a common power domain or having the same or not capacity/max frequency 
(or maybe
capabilities/extensions in the future), is not Linux specific. I just 
used the
Linux specific macros used by the Linux scheduler to point out the code 
path.
Even on other OSes we still need a way to include this information on 
the CPU
topology, and currently cpu-map doesn't. Also the Linux implementation 
of cpu-map
ignores multiple levels of shared resources, we only get one level for 
SMT and
one level for MC last time I checked.

And they are wrong, how the harts are physically packed doesn't imply 
their
actual topology. In general the "translation" is not always straight 
forward,
there are assumptions in place. We could use "cluster" of harts or 
"group" of
harts instead, they are more abstract.
