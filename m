This kinda comes back to the point I was making about it not changing the
configuration, just the point at which the configuration is applied. All
boards get this configuration eventually, it just seems to be that this
particular boot method needs it earlier?
I'm not sure that applying it earlier would break any boards (although
of course it could), I'd be more likely to think that having the
configuration at all is probably harmful in the cases where it is
harmful.

The other thing I don't really get is why the clk-pins node is needed at
the pre-ram stage but not the mmc-pins node. Surely both are needed? I
suppose it may be the case that the latter matches the default
configuration for the pins but not the former? If that's the case, the
node mmc-pins should get the property too IMO. I've added Hal into the
thread, maybe he can clear stuff up somewhat in that regard.

Ignoring the rest of this for now, these are the supported boards and
inferring sd from cd-gpios:

jh7110-deepcomputing-fml13v01.dts

Looks like sd on 1

jh7110-milkv-marscm-emmc.dts
jh7110-milkv-marscm-lite.dts

looks like sd on 0

jh7110-milkv-mars.dts

looks like sd on 1

jh7110-orangepi-rv.dts

ditto

jh7110-pine64-star64.dts

ditto

jh7110-starfive-visionfive-2-lite.dts

looks like sd on 0

jh7110-starfive-visionfive-2-lite-emmc.dts
jh7110-starfive-visionfive-2-v1.2a.dts

looks like sd on 1

jh7110-starfive-visionfive-2-v1.3b.dts

ditto

Would you be happier if only the boards with sd on mmc1 got the
property?

I'd like to say I will read the decompliation, but I look after this
platform as a favour and I just don't have the time to dedicate to
understanding it. There's a reason it took me ages to even circle back
to this.

In theory, the state of the hardware prior to the boot loader stage
consuming bootph-pre-ram shouldn't even matter, any node needed by the
stage should be marked with it even if that node matches the default
state of the pinctrl hardware. What the prior stage is or does shouldn't
matter, although of course people tend to only add pinctrl nodes or
annotations when software requirements/expecations don't match the state
it finds the hardware in.
