Hi,

Thanks for taking a look at this.

The kerneldoc ones? I guess i'm confused the kernel doc example in 
doc-guide/kernel-doc has

* function_name() - Brief description of function.

Ok, sure.

Ok, I was doing that because Lorenzo asked for it, but he hasn't said 
much so I will collapse it back together. That makes me happy, as 
splitting chunks between patches is a pain anyway.
