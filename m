It's hardly a "micro-optimisation" for drivers to just not touch an 
optional mechanism which offers no benefit to them, especially when in 
many cases said mechanism is newer than the code that isn't using it 
anyway. The only required semantic of .iotlb_sync is to ensure that any 
previous .unmap_pages calls are complete and their associated 
translations invalidated. The entire concept of gathering and deferred 
invalidation is irrelevant to many IOMMU designs where it would only 
stand to make overall invalidation performance worse.

I'm starting to wish I'd been able to page all this context back in 
before reviewing the first patch, as I too only really had Intel and 
SMMUv3 in mind at the time... :(

Ill-formed? It's a perfectly valid range for the purposes of any 
subsequent generic check - which couldn't realistically be anything 
beyond empty vs. non-empty anyway - and it's only being set at all in 
the case where we know the driver doesn't care, because if the driver 
*was* going to look at gather->start or gather->end in its .iotlb_sync 
then it must have already set them to meaningful values in the prior 
successful .unmap_pages call. I think we can safely consider it invalid 
for a driver to suddenly decide to start using a gather mid-way through 
an unmap (or indeed to use start/end in any intentionally non-obvious 
manner either).

Maybe try looking at the rest of the code around these lines...

Thanks,
Robin.
