Is 1.0 an actual version number corresponding to an exact, revision
controlled version of the IP or just something you made up? Looks like
the latter to me and I'm not a fan of s/w folks making up version
numbers for h/w. Standard naming convention is <vendor>,<soc>-<block>
unless you have good reason to deviate (IP for FPGAs where version
numbers are exposed to customers is one example).

And defining a version 2 when you find a quirk doesn't work. You've
already shipped the DT. You need to be able to fix issues with just an
OS update. This is why you are supposed to define a compatible string
for each and every SoC (and use a fallback when they are "the
same"TM).

The example is just an example and dts files can use either. For dts
files though, you should use the smallest size necessary and utilize
'ranges'. Some folks seem to think a 64-bit chip needs 64-bit address
and size everywhere. That's true at the top level typically, but
individual buses often don't span more than 4GB of address space. But
all that's out of scope of the example.

There are no "Linux device tree bindings". There are DT bindings that
happen to be hosting within the Linux tree for convenience.
