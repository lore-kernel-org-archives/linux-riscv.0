I think it is fine as is if my understanding is correct. Given this is
part of the RISC-V spec(s), then using 'riscv' here for riscv,cpu-intc
is fine. It was only the PLIC which didn't have any standard
definition that I had issue with. Plus, with the SoC specific string,
I'm not too worried about what the fallback is.

However, sifive,fu540-c000-cpu-intc does need to be documented.
Putting it in the example is not documenting it.
