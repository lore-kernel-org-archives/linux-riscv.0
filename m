Someone must have read the device tree specification incorrectly,
because we were putting timebase-frequency in the wrong place.  This
corrects the issue, moving it from

/ {
        cpus {
                timebase-frequency = X;
        }
}

to

/ {
        cpus {
                cpu at 0 {
                        timebase-frequency = X;
                }
        }
}

This is great, because the timer's frequency should really be a per-cpu
quantity on RISC-V systems since there's a timer per CPU.  This should
lead to some cleanups in our timer driver.
