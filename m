Hi Christoph,

while at it, IMHO it would be good to match the current
pcibios_add_device() prototype (ie returning an int error value)
so that this change can pave the way to removing yet another
pcibios call.

Actually we could make pcibios_add_device() removal as part of this
series but you would have to patch all related host bridge drivers
initializations so I am happy for this patch to go standalone (I can
patch the rest of the code) - I leave it to Bjorn's decision.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
