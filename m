I'd rather make /chosen mandatory on RISC-V than to have per-arch handling, as 
like you've said there's already too much duplication.  That said, it does seem 
like a bug to me because the behavior seems somewhat arbitrary -- an empty 
/chosen node causing the built-in command-line argument handling to go off the 
rails just smells so buggy.

If that's the case, could we at least have something like 
"CONFIG_OF_CHOSEN_IS_MANDATORY" that provides a warning when there is no 
/chosen node and is set on architecture where the spec mandates /chosen?

I've added linux-mips to see if anyone has any ideas.
