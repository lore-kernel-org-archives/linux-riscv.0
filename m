The original GIC driver deals with 2.5 revisions of the architecture
(yes, there was something pre-GICv1...), and implementers have been
creative to the extreme. Still, we could have done without most of these
compat strings. Hindsight and all that jazz.

GICv3 is a much more controlled architecture, and although people have
come up with a number of turds masquerading as implementations, it has
never been bad enough to mandate a different set of compat strings.
Also, you cannot describe that kind of stuff in ACPI, and we need to
support both, so we've come up with different ways of handling this.
