__GFP_RETRY_MAYFAIL is a leftover from __GFP_REPEAT times and from my
recollection it was pointless there. Or do we have any pte allocations
which are costly high order or that would rather fail than OOM kill and
retry.

Really there is no reason to preserve some code just because it is
written that way.

Anyway, as Mathew already pointed out. There is no real reason to
convert all arches at once. If you carve out a common implementation and
make it arch generic then you can go once arch at the time a reuse the
generic implementation. If there are still some arches which differ only
by __GFP_RETRY_MAYFAIL then talk to respective maintainers and ask them
what is the underlying reason.

See how that is a completely different and much more efficient way than
trying to make GFP_PGTABLE special and keep the code around?
