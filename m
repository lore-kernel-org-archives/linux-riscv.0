Isn't the hardware identified by "sifive,pwm0" and "sifive,fu540-c000"
effectively identical? Is there a need to have two compatible strings
that refer to the exact same hardware?

I would argue that if at some point there was indeed a chip with the
same name but a different IP block version in it, we can figure out what
to call it. Sure there are no guarantees, but it's still fairly unlikely
in my opinion, so I personally wouldn't worry about this up front.

Anyway, I don't feel strongly either way, I'm just pointing out that
this is somewhat unusual. If you want to keep it, feel free to.
