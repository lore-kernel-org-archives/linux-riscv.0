So, I only noticed your previous email last night on the mail archive, 
as I was applying your review/ack tags and couldn't find a response for 
this patch, seem the spam/etc filters need some further tweaking!

At that point, I was pretty sure the suggestion wasn't going to work out 
of the box as a lot of this code is running fairly early in the boot 
process. I spent a bit of time and plugged the change in to verify that 
assertion, and yes the per_cpu processor/acpi bits aren't setup early 
enough to be used by much of this code. It is being called from 
init_cpu_topology()/smp_prepare_cpus() which precedes 
do_basic_setup/do_initcalls() which is what runs the acpi_init() 
sequence which ends up eventually allocating the required data 
structures. So without restructuring the core boot sequence, this seems 
like a reasonable solution.


Thanks,
