It's worth noting that for KVM, the KVM hyp code is *tightly* coupled
with the host kernel (they are one single binary object), and the
calling convention between the two is an implementation detail that can
change at any time without any ABI concerns.

While I appreciate this might be trying to do the same thing from a
*functional* perspective, it's certainly different from a
maintainability perspective, and can't be treated in the same way.

My point was that you must not clobber those registers.

Looking at the TLFS document you linked below, it says:

| Note: X29 (FP/frame pointer), X30 (LR/link register), and SP are private
| per-VTL

... so clobbering those doesn't seem to be necessary anyway. Clearly
having an arbitrary calling convention is confusing for everyone.

That doesn't really address my concerns here.

I do not think that Linux should have to save/restore anything here;
that should be the job of the real hypervisor. The arbitrary separation
of PE state into private and shared (with shred state being directly
exposed to Linux) is a problem for maintainability and forward
compatibility.

Looking at the TLFS document you linked below, I see:

| Note: SVE state (Z0-Z31, P0-P15, FFR) and SME state are VTL-private.
| The lower 128-bit portion (Q registers) is shared, but the upper bits

... which is certainly going to be a pain to manage.

Note in particular "SME state" is not an architectural term. I don't
know which state in particular that is intended to cover (e.g. ZA, ZT0,
SVCR, all streaming mode state)?

There's no mention of SVCR, so I don't know how this is going to
interact with management of ZA state (ZA and ZT0, which are dependent
upon SVCR.ZA) or streaming mode (dependent upon SVCR.SM). That state has
been *incredibly* painful for us to manage generally. Regardless of the
SMCCC concerns, that needs to be specified better.

To be clear, that's Microsoft's problem, not the Linux kernel
community's problem. My NAK still stands.

Multiple years ago now, we made it clear that we would not accept a
non-SMCCC calling convention. Ignoring the substance of that feedback,
and inventing a new calling convention after that point is a
self-inflicted problem.

For shared state, aside fomr GPRs and FPSIMD/SVE/SME state, that says:

| * System Information Registers (read-only or non-security-critical):
|   * System identification and feature registers
|   * Cache and TLB type information

It's *implied* that some of those registers might be writable, but as
the specific set of registers is not described I cannot tell. Are there
any writable system registers which are shared?

I don't see how we can know which registers we might need to
save/restore without that being explicitly documented.

I also see:

| Note: SPE (Statistical Profiling Extension) state is shared across VTLs,
| except for PMBSR_EL1 which is VTL-private.

If "SPE state" includes PMBPTR or PMBLIMITR (which is the obvious
reading), this would be a security problem, as a lower-privileged VTL
could clobber those and cause SPE to write to arbitrary memory
immediately upon return to the higher-privileged VTL. Having PMBSR be
private on its own isn't sufficient to prevent that (e.g. since the
higher-privileged VTL could have its own active SPE profiling session).

I'm not keen on requiring hyper-v specific hooks in the SPE driver to
achieve that, and I'm also not keen on having hyper-v support code poke
SPE registers behind the SPE driver's back.

This does not give me confidence that any future PE state (e.g. things
like TRBE) will be managed in a safe way either.

Mark.
