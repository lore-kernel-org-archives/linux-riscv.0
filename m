I was interested in testing these on QDF2400, an ARM64 platform, since 
this series touches core ARM64 code and I'd hate to see a regression. 
However, I can't figure out what baseline to use to apply these. 
Different patches cause different conflicts of a variety of baselines I 
attempted.

What are these intended to apply to?

Also, you might want to run them through checkpatch next time.  There 
are several whitespace errors.
