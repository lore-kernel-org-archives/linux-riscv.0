Based on the discussion so far I think we should settle for sifive,plic +
an actual implementation string suggested by Palmer and Andrew.

This is what I have right now:

http://git.infradead.org/users/hch/riscv.git/commitdiff/1972707029f8f1216dbe14bd7791295e4b37f560

and which I'd like to send out before it is too late.
