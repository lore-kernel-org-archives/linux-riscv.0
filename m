So, presumably the problem is that the numa mask is smaller than the 
normal core_siblings...

I would verify that that there is a behavior change with something like 
/proc/schedstat | cut -d ' ' -f-2

There might be something odd happening with whether you have CONFIG_NUMA 
set (looking at that right now).

So, a couple quick todo's, see if the schedstat domains are changing 
with/without the last patch, and also see if they are changing if you 
enable/disable NUMA.

Why any of that matters for suspend isn't clear at the moment.
