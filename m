Right now the only direct consumers are said clocksource, the PLIC
driver later in this series and the RISC-V arch IPI code.  None of them
is going to do a manual enable_irq, so I guess the remote case of the
code is simply dead code.  I'll take a look at converting them to
per-cpu.  I guess the GICv2 driver is the best template?
