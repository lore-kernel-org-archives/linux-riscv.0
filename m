MC shouldn't be larger than any of the NUMA domains either.

That means we wouldn't support multi-die NUMA nodes?

IIUC, for numa-in-package it is a strict requirement that there is a
cache that span the entire NUMA node? For example, having a NUMA node
consisting of two clusters with per-cluster caches only wouldn't be
supported?

Isn't it more find core/node siblings? Or is it a requirement that the
last level cache spans exactly one NUMA node? For example, a package
level cache isn't allowed for numa-in-package?

I don't this guarantees that the cache level we found matches exactly
the NUMA node. Taking the two cluster NUMA node example from above, we
would set cache_level to point at the per-cluster cache as it is a
subset of the NUMA node but it would only span half of the node. Or am I
missing something?

Shouldn't the cache_id validity be checked here? I don't think it breaks
anything though.

Overall, I think this is more or less in line with the MC domain
shrinking I just mentioned in the v6 discussion. It is mostly the corner
cases and assumption about the system topology I'm not sure about.
