Could you elaborate on what this does better than cpu-map? I'd be
curious to see if we could/should augment cpu-map to cater for those
details.

Generally, we deliberately avoid placing software abstractions in the DT
(e.g. scheduler domains), because the design of these abstractions are
specific to a given software stack rather than the hardware, and even in
the context of that specific software stack these abstractions change
over time.

Placing software abstractions in the DT may seem simpler initially, but
longer term it ends up requiring translation anyway as abstractions
change, and typically it involves placing some policy in the DT, which
restricts the ability of software to do something better.

Having some translation between the DT and the Linux-internal
abstraction is how we expect things to work generally, and allows for a
more natural representation in the DT (which may be more or less
powerful than the current Linux abstraction).

Thanks,
Mark.
