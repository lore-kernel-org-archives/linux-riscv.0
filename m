I'm trying to understand what you mean. so the conclusion is that I need to drop the file
 'jh7110-starfive-visionfive-2-wm8960.dtso' from this patch.
When I submit the next version, just keep the TDM node and the pins configuration for TDM in patch [3/3],
need to drop the wm8960 stuff.
Right ?

Best regards,
Walker
