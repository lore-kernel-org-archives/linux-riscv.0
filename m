Thanks. I think it would be good to get someone who's familiar with linux/mm to take a look.

No I think this series should be pulled by the RISC-V maintainer. The other patches in this series just refactor some code and need to be ACK'ed by their ARCH developers but I suspect the series should be pulled into RISC-V. That said since it does touch other arch should it be pulled by mm? 

BTW note that RISC-V SPARSEMEM support is pretty useful for all manner of things and not just the p2pdma discussed in the cover.

You bet ;-)
