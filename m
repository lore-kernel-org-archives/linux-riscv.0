Sorry, I was a bit quick of the mark there. You'll need a forward
declaration for the paramater type. Here it is with a commit message,
although still untested because I haven't got round to setting up a riscv
toolchain yet.

Subject: [PATCH] riscv: tlb: Provide definition of tlb_flush() before
 including tlb.h

As of commit fd1102f0aade ("mm: mmu_notifier fix for tlb_end_vma"),
asm-generic/tlb.h now calls tlb_flush() from a static inline function,
so we need to make sure that it's declared before #including the
asm-generic header in the arch header.

Since tlb_flush() is a one-liner for riscv, we can define it before
including asm-generic/tlb.h as long as we provide a forward declaration
of struct mmu_gather.
