The "0" suffix refers to a revision number for the underlying PWM IP block.

It's certainly important to keep that version number on the 
"sifive,pwm0" compatible string that doesn't have the chip name 
associated with it.

As to whether there could ever be a FU540-C000 part with different IP 
block versions on it: FU540-C000 is ultimately a marketing name.? While 
theoretically we shouldn't have another "FU540-C000" chip with different 
peripheral IP block versions on it, I don't think any engineer can 
guarantee that it won't happen.
