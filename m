Confused. The timer and the IPI are separate causes and have nothing to do
with the per cpu irq domain. That's what the low level interrupt handling
code tells me.

If I understand correctly then the per cpu irq domain is for device
interrupts, right? If so, then this simply cannot work and there is no way
to make it work with per cpu interrupts either.

Is there some high level documentation about the design (or the lack of) or
can someone give a concise explanation how this stuff is supposed to work?

Thanks,
